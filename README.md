# real-time-face-detection-opencv

This project is a real-time face detection system developed using Python 3.11 and OpenCV. It uses the Haar Cascade classifier to detect multiple human faces from a live webcam feed and draws bounding boxes around detected faces with safe camera and window handling.


🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using webcam

Detects multiple faces simultaneously

Uses Haar Cascade pre-trained model

Fast and lightweight processing

Safe exit using keyboard (Q) or window close button

Compatible with Python 3.11 (Windows)



🛠️ Technologies Used
